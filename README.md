# MxM-Spring2019
This is a repo for LSTM development I made for the MxM RCOS project.
This code runs on Python 3 and uses Keras and Tensorflow technology.

Run customLSTM.py to run the LSTM. Change line 9 to a different filename to run a different text file on it.
Using this you can input a text file and output generated text that is meant to emulate the given text.
